Accurate segmentation is critical for real-time perception, decision-making, and control, enabling robots to navigate and operate in dynamic environments, avoiding obstacles, and detect objects of interest. Our project proceseses UAV-captured videos of Sabancı University’s Orhanlı via YOLO v.7 for real-time semantic segmentation. This project overcomes traditional challenges of shadow-induced detection errors through meticulous data annotation via LabelStudio, enhancing object detection under shadowed objects.</p> </body></html>
