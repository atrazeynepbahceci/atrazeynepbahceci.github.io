I am a Data Science Master's student at [Sabanci University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en/), Istanbul, Turkey. I am currently working on my thesis, Business POI Recommendations with Reinforcement Learning, in collabration with MIT Media Lab and supervised by [Prof. Selim Balcisoy](https://fens.sabanciuniv.edu/en/faculty-members/detail/746).

I completed my Bachelor's in Industrial Engineering, at [Istanbul Technical University](https://www.itu.edu.tr/en/homepage). For my Bachelor's graduation project, supervised by [Dr. Kutay Tinc]([https://www.media.mit.edu/), I developed a model that generates trading strategies for Istanbul Stock Exchange.

I have professional experiences with industry leaders such as Mercedes-Benz Turk and Procter & Gamble; and I am currently seeking new opportunities in the field of Artificial Intelligence.
