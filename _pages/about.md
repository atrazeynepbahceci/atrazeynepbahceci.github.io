I am a Data Science Master's student at [Sabanci University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en/) in Istanbul, Turkey, and a researcher at [Behavioral Analytics and Visualization Lab (BAVLAB)](https://analyticslab.sabanciuniv.edu/), co-founded by Sabanci University and the [MIT Media Lab's Human Dynamics Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/human-dynamics/overview/). I am currently working on my thesis Business POI Recommendations with Reinforcement Learning, supervised by [Prof. Selim Balcisoy](https://fens.sabanciuniv.edu/en/faculty-members/detail/746).

I completed my Bachelor's in Industrial Engineering, at [Istanbul Technical University](https://www.itu.edu.tr/en/homepage). For my Bachelor's graduation project, supervised by [Dr. Kutay Tinc](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kutay-hoca/), I developed a model that generates trading strategies for the Istanbul Stock Exchange.

I have professional experiences with industry leaders such as Mercedes-Benz Turk and Procter & Gamble, and I am currently seeking new opportunities in the field of Artificial Intelligence.
