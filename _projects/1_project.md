**Summary:** In this study, we developed a Deep Q-Network (DQN) model for creating stock market trading strategies, with a focus on the Istanbul Stock Exchange. The model starts with an initial cash sum and aims to maximize its assets through actions ranging from 'Strong Buy' to 'Strong Sell', while also considering risk by limiting the amount of cash it can spend at each time step. The model’s environment closely replicates the real-world setup; by including trading fees, Istanbul Stock Exchange’s 10% threshold, and so on. We tested the model on a portfolio including MAVI.IS, MGROS.IS, NUHCM.IS, PETKM.IS, and QNBFB.IS, starting with a budget of 20,000 TRY. The DQN model demonstrated significant performance despite the volatility and sectoral diversity of the stocks, achieving an asset increase well over the rate of return.
