**Summary:** In this study, we leveraged a Deep Q-Network (DQN) model to forge ahead in the realm of stock market trading strategies, focusing on the volatile yet opportunistic landscape of the Istanbul Stock Exchange. By engineering a model capable of executing decisions across a spectrum from 'Hold' to 'Strong Buy' and 'Strong Sell', we challenged the conventional wisdom of financial trading. The model's prowess was put to the test with a diverse portfolio comprising stocks with varying volatility and growth patterns, including MAVI.IS, MGROS.IS, NUHCM.IS, PETKM.IS, and QNBFB.IS. Starting with an initial capital of 20,000 TRY, our DQN model demonstrated exceptional financial acumen, navigating through the complexities of the market to amplify its assets, surpassing traditional return ratios. This study not only underscores the potential of reinforcement learning in financial decision-making but also marks a step forward in the application of artificial intelligence for enhancing stock market trading strategies.
