Deep Learning course project at Sabanci University

**Summary:** Accurate segmentation is critical in collaborative systems like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) for real-time perception, decision-making, and control, enabling robots to navigate and operate in dynamic environments, avoiding obstacles, and detecting objects of interest. Our project processes UAV-captured videos of Sabanci University's Orhanli campus via transfer learning on YOLO v.7 for real-time semantic segmentation. This project overcomes traditional challenges of shadow-induced detection errors through meticulous data annotation via LabelStudio, enhancing object detection under shadowed objects.
