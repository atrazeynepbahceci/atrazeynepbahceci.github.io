Deep Learning course project at Sabanci University

**Summary:** The importance of segmentation in robotics systems, particularly in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) collaborative systems, cannot be overstated. Accurate segmentation is critical for real-time perception, decision-making, and control, enabling robots to navigate and operate in dynamic environments, avoiding obstacles, and detecting objects of interest. Our project processes UAV-captured videos of Sabancı University's Orhanlı campus via YOLO v.7 for real-time semantic segmentation. This project overcomes traditional challenges of shadow-induced detection errors through meticulous data annotation via LabelStudio, enhancing object detection under shadowed objects.
